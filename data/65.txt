If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll.
[...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise.
There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems.
Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated).
This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model).
The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study.
The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality.
The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, proving that Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zou |first1=Di |last2=Xie |first2=Haoran |last3=Wang |first3=Fu Lee |last4=Kwan |first4=Reggie |date=2020-04-10 |title=Flipped learning with Wikipedia in higher education |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1080/03075079.2020.1750195 |journal=[[Studies in Higher Education]] |language=en |publisher=[[Routledge]] |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=1026\u20131045 |doi=10.1080/03075079.2020.1750195 |s2cid=216534736 |issn=0307-5079}}</ref>\n\n==== Medical information ====\n{{see also|Health information on Wikipedia}}\nOn March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite magazine |last=Beck |first=Julie |date=2014-03-05 |title=Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/doctors-1-source-for-healthcare-information-wikipedia/284206/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |issn=2151-9463 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221024070757/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/doctors-1-source-for-healthcare-information-wikipedia/284206/ |archive-date=2022-12-05 |access-date=2023-01-29}}</ref> Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of [[Amin Azzam]] at the [[University of San Francisco]] to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve [[health information on Wikipedia|Wikipedia articles on health-related issues]], as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by [[James Heilman]] to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.<ref name=\":10\" /> In a May 7, 2014 follow-up article in ''The Atlantic'' titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\"<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\">{{cite magazine |last=Beck |first=Julie |date=2014-05-07 |title=Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?

Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\".
Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\".
The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia.

Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The New York Times'' on February 9, 2014, quoted [[Erik M\u00f6ller]], deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.<ref name=\"small screen\" /> The article in ''The New York Times'' reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent.
And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"<ref name=\"small screen\" /> ''The New York Times'' reports that M\u00f6ller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation.

For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the [[Age of Enlightenment]] tradition of [[rationality]] triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a [[typography|typographic]] culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\".
Rather than \"{{lang|la|[[sapere aude]]}}\" ({{literal translation|dare to know|lk=on}}), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\".
This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\".

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK.
This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK.
The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.
[[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |last=Frauenfelder |first=Mark |date=November 21, 2000 |title=The next generation of online encyclopedias |website=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |url-status=live |access-date=2023-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/https://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g.
